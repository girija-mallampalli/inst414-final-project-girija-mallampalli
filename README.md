## Project Title: Optimizing Patient Inflow and Outflow Using Hospital Ratings
Overview:
This project aims to optimize patient inflow and outflow in hospitals by analyzing hospital quality data. By understanding the factors that impact patient experience and care effectiveness, hospitals can enhance their operational efficiency, reduce patient wait times, and improve overall healthcare delivery. The project utilizes data science techniques, including data extraction, cleaning, transformation, categorical encoding, and random forest regression, to derive actionable insights from hospital quality metrics.


## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available hospital quality datasets:

## Code Package Structure
etl/:
* extract.py: Extract data from CSV files.
              Handle encoding issues and load data into pandas DataFrames.
  
* transform.py: Clean the data by selecting relevant columns and handling missing values.
                Encode categorical variables to prepare the data for analysis.
  
* load.py: Script for loading cleaned data into a new csv

analysis/:
* model.py: Use Random Forest Regressor to model the relationship between hospital quality metrics and patient experience.
            Train the model using a portion of the dataset and evaluate it on a test set.

* evaluation.py: Calculate performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to assess the model's accuracy.
                 Compare the model's predictions with actual values to identify key areas for hospital improvement.

vis/:
* visualization.py: Generate visualizations, such as correlation matrices and feature importance plots, to better understand the data and model results.
Save visualizations as PNG files for reporting and analysis.

main.py: Main script to run the entire process (data cleaning, encoding, model training).
